## About Project

Project name: re:solution

Goal of project is to build robust back-end production redy boilerplate sign up and authentication system based on my knowledge and experience using NestJS.

Additionaly i'll try to include some basic "useful" services, particularly from this project, for example: just to demonstrate how to work with PosgreSQL, how to work with various public API -s... so on and so force.

Ideas of creative entusiasts, NestJS lovers and in general open sorce project lovers are welcome to contribute, but before please contact me @ lado.grigalashvili@gmail.com.
